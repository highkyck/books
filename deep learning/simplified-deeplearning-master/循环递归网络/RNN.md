## RNN
However, MLP is unable to approximate the functions outside the region. We could use RNN to approximate some periodic functions such as $sin(x)$, and it could be used in time series prediction.

![sinx](img/sinx.png?raw=true "sinx")
![sinxx](img/sinxx.png?raw=true "sinxx")

We use RNN to approximate $sin(x)$ and $sin(x) * \sqrt[10]{x}$ which respectively shown in the above figures.
